# Fundamentals

In this section, you will find some of the concepts needed to start your journey with non-parametric Bayesian Networks. Specifically, you can find:

- The concept of covariance and correlation
- The multivariate Gaussian distribution

Note that there are other concepts that you have already seen in the course and that have not been included yet in this book such as the concept of Gaussian copula.
